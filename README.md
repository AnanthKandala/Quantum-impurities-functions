# Quantum-impurities-functions
Commonly used python functions for analyzing, plotting NRG spectra.

Plotting functions:

`plot_levels_abs`: plot the NRG spectrum and color code the levels according to their jf quantum number.

`plot_levels_rel`: plot the NRG spectrum and color code the levels according to their relative jf quantum number from the ground state.
